# 🛡 **Integrated Cybersecurity Portfolio**

## **Introduction: Connecting Technical Skills with Business Risk**

I am a Cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in both the *technical side* of security and the *governance and compliance* practices that support business resilience.

This repository highlights my “T-shaped” cybersecurity skill set:

1. **Technical Depth (Blue/Red Team):**  
   Hands-on experience identifying, exploiting, and defending systems through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and virtual labs on platforms such as Hack The Box (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM).

2. **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC):**  
   Practical experience translating technical findings into policies, risk registers, and compliance documentation—demonstrated through a structured, multi-week cybersecurity internship with *Excelerate*.

My goal is to bridge technical understanding with strong GRC fundamentals, ensuring that organizations can manage risk effectively while aligning security controls with frameworks like **NIST CSF** and **ISO 27001**.

## **Portfolio Structure**

This repository is organized into folders that showcase my work across different cybersecurity domains. Each write-up demonstrates applied skills, real problem-solving, and practical thinking.

---

### ✅ **1. Internship-Case-Studies (Professional GRC)**  
*Demonstrates:*  
- Security policy drafting  
- Risk identification & assessment  
- Control mapping (NIST & ISO 27001)  
- Clear communication with non-technical stakeholders  
- Development of a full Cyber Risk & Compliance Report  

| Project | Focus Area | Write-up |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Excelerate Cyber Risk & Compliance Internship** | Risk Assessment, Compliance Gap Analysis, Report Writing | [Read Write-up](https://github.com/FranklineO-sec/Cyber-Security-Writeups/blob/main/Internship-Case-Studies/excelerate-writeup.md) |

This section will expand as I complete more professional or simulated case studies in Governance, Risk, and Compliance.

---

### ✅ **2. CTF-Writeups (Technical: Red/Blue Team)**  
*Hands-on technical analysis from real challenges on HTB and THM:*  
- Vulnerability identification  
- Exploitation methodologies  
- Post-exploitation and mitigation notes  
- Clear, step-by-step technical explanations  

More write-ups will be added as they are finalized and documented.

## **Purpose of This Portfolio**

This repository showcases my progression as a cybersecurity professional—  
not just the technical challenges I solve, but *how I think*, *how I communicate*, and *how I approach security from both a technical and governance perspective*.

My long-term goal is to build a career that blends:
- Risk assessment  
- Compliance frameworks  
- Technical troubleshooting  
- Policy and governance  
- Secure system design

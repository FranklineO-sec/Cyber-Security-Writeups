# 📘 Excelerate Cyber Risk & Compliance Internship – Case Study

## 1. **Overview**

| **Detail** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Role** | Cyber Risk & Compliance Intern |
| **Duration** | 4 Weeks |
| **Focus Area** | Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) |
| **Goal** | To perform a full-cycle cyber risk assessment and compliance analysis, aligning risks with NIST CSF & ISO 27001 while drafting professional GRC documentation. |

This write-up summarizes my work during the Excelerate Cyber Risk & Compliance Internship. All examples have been generalized to protect confidential information. Technical or proprietary details tied to internal systems have been anonymized.

## 2. **Key Project: Cyber Risk Assessment for a Remote Startup**

### ✅ **Project Description**
I conducted a multi-phase cyber risk assessment for a fully remote e-commerce startup. The environment relied heavily on cloud-based tools such as productivity suites, financial platforms, and communication channels.

### ✅ **Challenge**
The organization had no formal security policies and minimal governance. Several practices, including shared credentials, lack of MFA, and informal data handling—introduced significant risks. A notable issue involved a **high-risk vulnerability in a mission-critical internal application** (generalized to maintain confidentiality).

### ✅ **Actions Taken**
- Mapped all business assets (data, users, tools, workflows).  
- Identified threats and vulnerabilities through structured analysis.  
- Conducted likelihood and impact scoring to prioritize risks.  
- Mapped each risk to **NIST CSF** and **ISO 27001** controls.  
- Drafted a full Cyber Risk & Compliance Report with recommendations.  
- Developed a realistic compliance roadmap tailored to a startup environment.

### ✅ **Impact / Outcome**
- Produced a structured **risk register**, improving visibility on high-priority risks.  
- Highlighted compliance gaps and proposed practical mitigation steps.  
- Improved the organization’s alignment with globally recognized frameworks.  
- Strengthened the foundation for future policy development and governance.

## 3. **Policy Drafting & Control Mapping**

### ✅ **Key Deliverable**
A complete **Cyber Risk & Compliance Report** that included:

- Asset inventory  
- Threat & vulnerability matrix  
- Compliance gap analysis  
- Control mapping  
- Risk mitigation recommendations  
- Short- and long-term compliance roadmap  

### ✅ **Control Mapping (NIST CSF & ISO 27001)**
Each identified risk was aligned with relevant control categories. Examples (generalized):

| **Risk Area** | **NIST CSF Category** | **ISO 27001 Control** |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Weak authentication practices | PR.AC – Access Control | A.5.17 – Authentication Management |
| Public access to sensitive data | PR.DS – Data Security | A.8.2 – Information Access Control |
| Lack of incident response process | RS.RP – Response Planning | A.5.24 – Incident Management |
| Missing employee awareness training | PR.AT – Security Awareness | A.6.3 – Training & Awareness |
| No centralized logging | DE.CM – Continuous Monitoring | A.8.16 – Logging & Monitoring |

### ✅ **Skills Highlighted**
- Risk analysis & prioritization  
- Security policy comprehension  
- Compliance frameworks (NIST & ISO 27001)  
- Technical-to-nontechnical translation  
- Documentation & professional reporting  
- Collaborative research and structured problem solving

## 4. **Key Learning & Professional Takeaways**

### ✅ **1. Clear Understanding of Compliance vs Technical Security**
This internship helped me understand the distinction between:
- **Security policy (the why & what)** – purpose, expectations, control requirements  
- **Technical implementation (the how)** – configurations, tools, and security measures  

I learned how policies drive technical decisions and how technical findings inform governance.

### ✅ **2. Stronger Communication Skills**
I practiced:
- Summarizing technical risks for non-technical managers  
- Writing executive summaries, risk statements, and reports  
- Presenting findings in a clear business-oriented language  

### ✅ **3. Practical GRC Experience**
I gained hands-on exposure to:
- Risk scoring  
- Gap analysis  
- Control mapping  
- Compliance roadmapping  
- Drafting realistic recommendations  

### ✅ **4. Future Goal**
My goal is to continue growing as a cybersecurity professional who can bridge:
- Technical insights  
- Business risk  
- Compliance frameworks  
to help organizations build stronger, more resilient security programs.
